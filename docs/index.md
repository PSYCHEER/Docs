# :material-home: Welcome to PSYCHEER's Documentation

As GitHub allows to have pages on username or organization name and I don't want uselessly spend money on domains, I want to keep this site as https://psycheer.github.io as documentation for all of kind of my products, featuring **NovaBot** as my most advanced code art.
I'm hopeful about you'll find all of the informations you will need to know, otherwise you can contribute into this wiki or contact me on Discord.
