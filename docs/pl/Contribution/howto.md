# How to contribute into GitHub

Contributing to our GitHub repository is a great way to help improve the project. Follow these steps to contribute:

## 1. Fork the Repository

First, you need to fork the repository. This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

1. Go to the repository: [PSYCHEER/psycheer.github.io](https://github.com/PSYCHEER/psycheer.github.io)
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.

## 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PSYCHEER/psycheer.github.io.git
cd psycheer.github.io
```

## 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch to work on your changes.
```sh
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

Replace my-new-branch with a descriptive name for your branch.

## 4. Edit Files

Make the necessary changes to the files. You can use any text editor or IDE to edit the files.
??? tip
    Our recommendation is [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## 5. Commit Your Changes

After making your changes, commit them to your branch.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Description of the changes"
```

## 6. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

```sh
git push origin my-new-branch
```

## 7. Create a Pull Request

Finally, create a pull request to merge your changes into the original repository.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
3. Provide a title and description for your pull request.
4. Click on the "Create pull request" button.

Your pull request will be reviewed, and if everything is in order, it will be merged into the main repository.
